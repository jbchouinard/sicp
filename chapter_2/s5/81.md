# SICP Exercise 2.81

## a.

apply-generic does not find a procedure with (get 'exp 'complex 'complex).

apply-generic finds a complex->complex coercion procedure. it coerces the
first argument to type complex. It calls itself recursively with the new
args, which are still of type 'complex 'complex.

Unless a procedure has appeared since the last call, which is unlikely,
apply-generic will continue to not find a procedure with (get 'exp 'complex 'complex).

It will call itself recursively ad infinitum. Louis Reasoner is not a smart man.

## b.

It sorts of work correctly though, arguably, it is pointlessly wasting cycles
looking for same-type coercions. (e.g. looking for a complex->complex coercion
if it is called with an op that does not exit on complex numbers.

One thing it could try that would actually be useful is coercing both
arguments to a type for which the operation exists.

## c.

See code in arithmetic package (when this was commited).
