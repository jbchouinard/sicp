# SICP Exercise 1.24

### prime vs fast-prime

Let's compare `prime?` and `fast-prime?` (with n=5).

`prime?`, using the divisors method:

    10000000000037 *** 3.94
    10000000000051 *** 3.88
    10000000000099 *** 3.92

`fast-prime?`, using the fermat test:

    10000000000037 *** 0.
    10000000000051 *** 0.
    10000000000099 *** 0.

Looks like we'll need to increase input size to get non-zero runtimes on `fast-prime?`.

Calculating the 3 primes larger than 10^199 took 0.04s with `fast-prime?`. Extrapolating from our previous runs, knowing that the `prime?` procedure grows as \\(\sqrt{n}\\), we estimate that this would have taken 1.2x10^86 years to compute with `prime?` (9x10^75 times the age of the universe).
