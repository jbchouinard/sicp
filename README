# SICP Exercise Solutions

My solutions to exercises and projects from Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs 2nd ed.

The code was tested with MIT/GNU Scheme 9.1.1 on Ubuntu 16.04.

```
sudo apt-get install mit-scheme
```

Most programs depend on schemerc.scm, it must be loaded first.

```
mit-scheme --load schemerc.scm FILE ...
```
